## Features:

1. **Algorithms:**

- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Dijkstra's Algorithm

2. **Maze and Terrain Generation:**

- Random maze generation
- Weighted terrains for use with Dijkstra's Algorithm

3. **Interactive Canvas:**

- Paint your own custom mazes and terrains to test the algorithms on.
