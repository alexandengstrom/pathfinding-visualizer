# Pathfinding Visualizer

Welcome to the Pathfinding Visualizer! This tool was built using React and is designed to help you visualize different pathfinding algorithms in action. Whether you're learning about these algorithms for the first time or just want to see them in action, this visualizer provides a comprehensive and interactive platform.

## Features

1. **Algorithms:**

- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Dijkstra's Algorithm

2. **Maze and Terrain Generation:**

- Random maze generation
- Weighted terrains for use with Dijkstra's Algorithm

3. **Interactive Canvas:**

- Paint your own custom mazes and terrains to test the algorithms on.
